# Horse-Race

## A console app that simulates a horse race

I built this project to experiment with inheritance and BigDecimal early in my 14-week programming bootcamp with TechElevator.  You can bet on two horses - Buttercup and Night Mare.  Both run a random number of steps each round of the race, but the random steps function for each has been overwritten so that Buttercup makes slow and steady progress while Nightmare often stalls and leaps ahead.  Both have an equal chance of winning though, so try your luck betting on either!
